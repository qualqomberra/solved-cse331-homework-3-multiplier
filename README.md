 </noscript>Your Logisim design will have two circuit files: control.circ and datapath.circ. You will combine them in a mult32.circ file to have the 32 bit multiplier.

Your Control Unit will implement the below ASM:

<ul>

 <li>Write a report showing and explaining the three circ files.</li>

 <li>Perform simulations and check for accuracy. Not working designs will not get above 30pts. If the mistake is small it is your responsibility to find and correct it.</li>

 <li>Cheating results in -100 even from outer resources if not mentioned in the report.</li>

</ul>
